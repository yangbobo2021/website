# META: Spec Definition

## Intent

This spec defines the structure and organization of specifications (specs), per [DR-000](decisions/000-spec-structure-format.md).

## Organization

### META-1

The `specs/` directory shall contain the following subdirectories and files:

| Path | Content | File Naming |
| --------- | ------- | ------ |
| `decisions/` | Decision records (DRs) | \<NNN\>-\<kebab-case\>.md |
| `iterations/` | Iteration records (IRs) | \<NNN\>-\<kebab-case\>.md |
| `user/` | item files for user-visible behavior | [\<path\>/]\<kebab-case\>.md |
| `dev/` | item files for implementation requirements | [\<path\>/]\<kebab-case\>.md |
| `test/` | item files for acceptance testing | [\<path\>/]\<kebab-case\>.md |
| `map.md` | spec index for navigation with item files organized by packages | - |
| `meta.md` | the spec of specs | - |

### META-3

Each item file shall include an `## Intent` section stating its purpose.

### META-21

Test items shall focus on integration and system testing.

Unit tests shall be part of the implementation and shall not be specified as spec items.

## Record format

### META-4

Each decision record (DR) shall follow the ADR format [[2]] with the following sections: Status, Context, Decision, and Consequences.

### META-5

Each iteration record (IR) shall contain the following sections: Goal, Deliverables (with checkboxes), Tasks (numbered, each in one-commit size), and Acceptance criteria.

### META-23

DRs and IRs shall be written in concise language, including only what is needed to act on or audit the record, with preference for bullets and tables over prose paragraphs.

### META-24

A DR shall specify design decisions and constraints, not duplicate implementation logic.
A DR is sufficient when an implementer can generate or audit code from the design intent, constraints, and tradeoffs.
Implementation details shall be included only when they are part of the design contract.

### META-25

In prose paragraphs of DRs and IRs, each sentence shall begin on a new line for diff readability.
List items and table cells are exempt, since their delimiters already isolate per-entry changes.
Fixed-width column wrapping within a sentence is allowed.

## Item syntax

### META-6

Each spec item shall use the GEARS pattern [[1]]:

```text
[Where <static precondition(s)>] [While <stateful precondition(s)>] [When <trigger>] The <subject> shall <behavior>.
```

Clauses and punctuation shall follow standard English conventions.

| Clause | Purpose | Example |
| ------ | ------- | ------- |
| Where | Static preconditions (features, config) | Where debug mode is enabled |
| While | Stateful preconditions (runtime state) | While the connection is active |
| When | Trigger event (at most one) | When the user clicks submit |
| shall | Required behavior | The form shall validate inputs |

### META-7

Where test cases are expressed by Given-When-Then (GWT), their spec items shall map GWT to GEARS [[1]]:

| GWT | Clause |
| --- | ------ |
| Given | Where + While |
| When | When |
| Then | shall |

### META-8

Each item shall be self-contained:

- It shall have no implicit dependency on sections other than its own subsections.
- Citations to other specs or shared sections shall be explicit.

### META-26

A spec item shall describe behavior as observable outcomes (e.g., file state, exit code, printed output, return value, network call) under named conditions, including any conditions under which a particular outcome shall not occur.

## Spec packages

### META-9

A spec package shall consist of one to three coordinated item files sharing the same relative path and basename under `user/`, `dev/`, or `test/`.

### META-10

A spec package shall have a basename \<kebab-case\>.md unique across `specs/user/`, `specs/dev/`, and `specs/test/`, with a short form \<ALLCAPS\>.

Example: `package-management.md` has short form `PKGMGT`.

### META-11

Each item shall have an ID unique within `specs/`, following \<PACK\>-\<N...\> format (e.g., AUTH-11, URL-3) as a markdown heading for anchor linking.

Note: \<PACK\> refers to the short form of the package name.

### META-12

Item IDs shall not be modified once released; new items shall use higher IDs per package.

### META-13

A spec package shall define a closed set of subjects and their behaviors for a single intent. The shall clause (see [META-6](#meta-6)) of any item shall only involve subjects and behaviors within its own package.

### META-14

The precondition and trigger clauses (Where, While, When; see [META-6](#meta-6)) of items shall be allowed to reference subjects and behaviors from other spec packages.

### META-15

Each spec package shall minimize references to the containing project. When a project-specific reference is essential to a package's intent, it shall be documented in the package's `## Intent` section.

## Citation

### META-16

Citations to specific items shall use relative links with anchors (e.g., `[META-1](meta.md#meta-1)`).

### META-17

DRs and items shall be allowed to cite each other.

### META-18

IRs shall not be cited by any spec except `map.md`.

### META-19

External references in specs shall cite authoritative sources (e.g., official docs) with numbered markers (e.g., `[[1]]`) linked to specific URLs in a `## References` section that shall have no uncited entries.

### META-20

Each test item shall include one `Verifies:` metadata line immediately below its item ID heading.

The `Verifies:` line shall contain one or more comma-separated [citations](#meta-16) to the user or dev items that the test item verifies.
